## Legacy scripts

This folder contains scripts used with `brainglobe-template-builder v0.0.x`, which importantly included de-novo templates made by the BrainGlobe team for the Eurasian blackcap brain, the African mole-rat brain, and the developing fruit fly wing disc. These file live here as a reference, but are not expected to run out-of-the box, even on our internal systems. They include a lot of code duplication.

Template generation should now use `brainglobe-template-builder>=0.1` which is significantly simpler to script. See the `crab/` folder for an example.
